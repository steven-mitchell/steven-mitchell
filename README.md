# Welcome to my nerd-zone! 

I'm a wildlife biologist and environmental scientist with 10 years of experience working for the US Forest Service, National Park Service, and in private consulting. I'm currently in grad school developing expertise in Environmental Policy and Conservation Planning. This GitHub account will eventually be used a professional portfolio to show off my awesome quantitatve skills, but right now, it mostly holds my homework assignments.
