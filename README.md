I'm a wildlife biologist with 8 years of experience working for the US Forest Service, National Park Service, and in private consulting. I'm currently in grad school developing expertise in Data Science and Environmental Policy. This GitHub account will eventually be used a professional portfolio to show off my awesome quantitatve skills, but right now, it mostly holds my homework assignments.
