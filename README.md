Through my 10 years of experience in conservation biology and public land management, I bring expertise in leading environmental projects and programs to inform management decisions. In past jobs, I've authored Biological Assessments, Environmental Impact Statements, technical reports, and policy recommendation memos to shape management decisions impacting public lands. Beyond my technical expertise, I have also worked as a policy advisor and facilitator of collaborative management via my Masterâ€™s project with TNC Colorado.

Some highlights:


â€¢	Program Managementâ€”With the NPS and as a private consultant, hired, trained, and supervised professional-level staff, managed complex budgets, oversaw equipment acquisition and maintenance, and navigated adherence to state and federal statutes and administrative rules. 
 
â€¢	Ecological Knowledgeâ€”As a wildlife biologist with consistently increasing responsibility in private consulting, the USFS, and the NPS, demonstrated in-depth knowledge of Pacific Northwest speciesâ€™ biology, ecology, life histories, habitat dynamics, threats, and conservation needs.

â€¢	Technical Literacyâ€”Through graduate coursework and prior experience as a federal compliance lead, demonstrated ability to assess and fact-check complex statistical models, interpret data to determine best course of action, and visualize trends to justify decision-making. 

â€¢	Collaborative Conservationâ€”Facilitated adaptive management of forest lands and fostered collaboration across jurisdictional boundaries as a federal biologist and as a Climate Adaptation Fellow with TNC, applying my knowledge of public planning principles and techniques, environmental regulations and compliance, laws, and legal codes.
